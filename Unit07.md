**Unit 7: Population Ecology** <span id="7"></span> 
*We will now learn about ecology, the study of the interactions between
organisms and their environments.  Ecology is not the same as
environmental studies or environmentalism.  It is instead closely
related to the study of evolution and genetics and other biology topics.
 As you might imagine, the study of organisms and the environment can be
very complicated since we not only have to keep track of all the
organisms within an environment, but their changing environments as
well.  The concepts of ecology are thus not as explicitly defined as
other subjects in biology.  They are generalized explanations of natural
phenomenon rather than specific names and functions of molecules or cell
structures.  A lot of the principles of ecology involve some algebra
since they deal with large numbers and variables.  Be sure to brush up
on your math to fully understand this unit!*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Understand what factors determine populations’ distribution and
    abundance.
-   Distinguish between logistic and exponential growth and know when
    each type of growth is expected to occur.
-   Identify factors that influence carrying capacity understand how
    carrying capacity for a single population can change over time
    depending on the abundance of resources.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the effects competition and
    predation have on populations’ sizes, distribution, and niches.
-   Distinguish between types of symbiosis (parasitism, commensalism,
    mutualism) and understand which species derive benefits or
    disadvantages from each type of interaction.
-   Identify situations in which succession will and will not occur.
-   Understand how different types of organisms will be present at
    different stages of succession.

     Instructions: Watch this lecture, starting at the 9-minute mark.
     Please note that although the lecture is labeled “Species
    Interactions,” the professor was one day behind in her syllabus, so
    the lecture in fact deals with population distributions and size.  
      
     Watching this lecture and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Read from the second section, “Population Growth,”
    through the end of the page. Population growth is limited or
    controlled by the carrying capacity (abbreviated as K) of a
    population.  A population’s carrying capacity is the number of
    individuals that can be supported by the resources available to that
    population.  If, for example, there is only so much vegetation in an
    area for that area’s moose population to eat, then the carrying
    capacity of moose would be the number of individuals that would have
    enough vegetation to survive in that area.  Carrying capacities can
    change depending on the existence and abundance of resources.  Some
    limiting resources include food, water, appropriate habitat, and
    appropriate territory sizes.  
      
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

     This lecture covers the material in sub-subunits 7.2.1 through
    7.2.3.  Please note that populations demonstrating density-dependent
    growth and leveling out at carrying capacity (K) are generally
    referred to as showing “logistic” growth (on a graph, an S-shaped
    curve), whereas populations with density-independent growth  exhibit
    “exponential” growth (on a graph, a J-shaped curve).
