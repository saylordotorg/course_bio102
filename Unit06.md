**Unit 6: Phylogeny and Taxonomy** <span id="6"></span> 
*Now that we generally understand how natural selection and evolution
work, we will take a look at the study of phylogeny, the field of
biology that studies the evolutionary development and diversification of
a species (also known as phylogenesis).  You might think of phylogenesis
as an evolutionary tree, where the tree trunk is the common ancestor of
all life on Earth.  Over time, species have branched off the main tree
trunk to form their own “branches.”  As you might imagine, this tree of
life is full of branches and sub-branches!  Phylogeny can also help us
explain how animals share certain common features while being quite
different from one another (for example, how cats, dogs, bears, and
humans have four limbs but are clearly distinct from one another).  
    
 Meanwhile, taxonomy deals with the question of how we classify these
different types of animals.  Carl Linnaeus answered this question with
the invention of the binomial nomenclature system, a formal system for
naming different species.  Scientists have now categorized all living
organisms into six kingdoms.  Every living organism has a scientific
name derived from Linnaeus’s original work.*
