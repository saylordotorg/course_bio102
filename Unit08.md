**Unit 8: Ecosystems** <span id="8"></span> 
*The term “ecosystem” is all-encompassing.  It can be used to describe
all the living and non-living things in an environment and is therefore
a relative term.  It can describe a park that covers a city block, or an
entire tropical island that covers several thousand square miles!  You
need to understand the flow of energy and matter within an environment
in order to truly understand what an ecosystem is all about.  Most
often, this flow of matter is cyclical, which explains why we talk about
“the carbon cycle,” “the nitrogen cycle,” and so forth.  The flow of
energy is usually unidirectional (that is, from the sun to the “top”
carnivores) and is typically represented by a food chain or food web,
terms that you have most likely known since elementary school.*

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Explain what processes will be affected by a disruption in the water
    cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, or phosphorous cycle.
-   Distinguish between autotrophs and heterotrophs, even in unfamiliar
    situations (for example, an ecosystem involving chemosynthetic
    bacteria).
-   Explain why there are fewer large secondary consumers than there are
    primary producers.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the complexity of most food webs and
    the disproportionate effects that some species can have on them (for
    example, keystone species).
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the effects of temperature and
    humidity on biodiversity in land biomes.
-   Identify different types of marine biomes, those where life is more
    abundant, those where it is more diverse, and why.
