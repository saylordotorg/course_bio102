**Unit 3: Darwinian Natural Selection** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit focuses on the idea of evolution through natural selection as
first proposed by Charles Darwin.  He developed this theory after he
visited the Galapagos Islands, where he observed and recorded the
phenotypes of the various birds and other animals he found there.  He
later expanded upon these observations in his book* The Origin of
Species*, which laid the foundation for his theory of evolution.  He
proposed that species changed slowly over time and not within their own
lifetimes, thereby rejecting many of the theories that had previously
been used to explain species diversity and change.  A number of
scientific discoveries have since substantiated the theory and helped
explain the course of life on earth.  We will begin this unit by looking
at the major theory in circulation prior to Darwin’s and then directly
examine Darwin’s theories.  We will conclude by taking a look at some of
the evidence supporting the theory of natural selection.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Distinguish between Lamarck’s arguments about the process of species
    change and Darwin’s theory of evolution.
-   Understand fitness and the process of adaptation.
-   Understand the effect of environment on plastic phenotypes and be
    able to distinguish this type of change from evolutionary change.
-   Distinguish between natural selection and sexual selection.
-   Recognize types of sexual-selection advantages.
-   Correctly identify figures representing either directional,
    stabilizing, or disruptive selection and correctly identify
    situations that would cause any of the above types of selection.
-   Understand the findings of paleontologists, such as Dozhansky and
    Mayr, and geneticists that support evolutionary theory.
