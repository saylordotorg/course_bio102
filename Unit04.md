**Unit 4: Evolution of Populations** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit expands upon our understanding of evolution by looking beyond
natural selection.  Although natural selection is one way that
populations evolve, there are other ways that a population of species
can change over time.  We will now look at the major concepts behind
these types of change.  We will first introduce the Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium, where the variation within a population does not change
from generation to generation, given five basic assumptions about the
population.  We will then look at these assumptions in detail and
examine how they change the genetic pool of a population when violated.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Understand the meaning and purpose of the Hardy-Weinberg
    Equilibrium, as well as what different values would mean for a
    population.
-   Identify the assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of situations in which violations of
    the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium occur.
