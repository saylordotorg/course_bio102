**Unit 1: Mendelian Genetics** <span id="1"></span> 
*We will begin this course by taking a look at how certain features of
an organism, such as hair color or bone length, get passed on from
generation to generation.  The Augustinian monk Gregor Mendel first
discovered the rules of inheritance for these features* – *more commonly
known as traits* – *through his experiments with pea plants in the
1800s.  These experiments showed that certain traits were always
dominant to other traits, meaning that if, for example, a red flower
were mated with a white flower, the offspring would always be red
because red was the “dominant” trait.  Mendel also found that the
passing of certain traits to offspring became remarkably predictable
when certain simple ratios were used.  The rules he uncovered when
making these observations are now known as Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance.
 The idea that traits are passed on from generation to generation is
fundamental to understanding how evolution works.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Distinguish between a phenotype and genotype.

    individuals with homozygous or heterozygous genotypes, including
    dihybrid crosses that involve two separate, unlinked
    characteristics.

     Instructions: First, read the “Glossary of Genetic Terms,” then
    read the sections “Heredity, Historical Perspective” and “The Monk
    and His Peas.”  Do not focus on the botany terms related to the
    garden pea; just know that the physiology of garden peas made them
    very useful experimental subjects, because Mendel could control
    their pollination to one another or allow them to self-pollinate. 
    *A “genotype” refers to the specific genes that an organism carries.
     A “phenotype” refers to the physical appearance of an organism that
    results from the combination of these genes and an individual’s
    environment.*

**1.3.2 Test Cross** <span id="1.3.2"></span> 
*Note: A test cross is a test that determines the genotype of an
organism for a particular trait.  Usually, a test cross involves
crossing (or breeding) an organism that has an unknown genotype with an
organism that is homozygous recessive for that trait and then looking at
the ratio of dominant and recessive phenotypes in order to determine the
genotype.  A backcross is a cross between a heterozygous
F<sub>1 </sub>individual and one of its homozygous parents. *
