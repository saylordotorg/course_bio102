**Unit 5: Speciation** <span id="5"></span> 
*When certain events occur in history, a population of organisms will
undergo what is called “speciation,” a process in which two species
emerge from one.  There are many reasons why speciation can occur, and
we will talk about the major ones in this unit.  Darwin first became
aware of speciation when he studied the birds of the Galapagos,
including his famous finches, and noticed how many of them resembled one
another and at the same time had very important differences.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 4.5 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define a species.
-   List types of isolating mechanisms.
-   Identify which isolating mechanism(s) would be operating under given
    circumstances.
-   Understanding that most hybrids have much lower fitness that their
    parents.
-   Distinguish between allopatric and sympatric speciation and
    recognize examples of each.
-   Distinguish between punctuated equilibrium and gradualist models of
    evolution.

**5.1 Prezygotic Isolating Mechanisms (Habitat Isolation, Temporal
Isolation, Behavioral Isolation, Mechanical Isolation, Gametic
Isolation), Postzygotic Isolating Mechanisms (Zygotic Mortality, Hybrid
Inviability, Hybrid Sterility, Hybrid Breakdown), and Speciation
(Allopatric, Sympatric, and Adaptive)** <span id="5.1"></span>

     Instructions: Read the entirety of the webpage. Please note that
    there are prezygotic and postzygotic isolating mechanisms listed in
    the reading, but they are not clearly defined.  The prezygotic
    isolating mechanisms include Habitat/Geographical Isolation,
    Temporal Isolation, Behavioral Isolation, Mechanical Isolation, and
    Gametic Isolation.  The postzygotic isolating mechanisms include
    Zygotic Mortality, Hybrid Inviability, Hybrid Sterility, Hybrid
    Breakdown, and Hybrid Sterility.  
      
     **Habitat/Geographical:** Occupy different geographic areas  
     **Temporal:** Mate at different times  
     **Behavioral:** Behavior does not elicit mating  
     **Mechanical:** Differences in sex organs  
     **Gametic:** Failure of sperm to meet egg.  
     **Zygote mortality:** Fertilization occurs and zygote does not
    develop.  
     **Hybrid inviability:** Embryo forms but viability is reduced (A
    mule is the offspring of two different species of animals – a female
    horse and a male donkey – and is a result considered a “hybrid”
    animal).  
     **Hybrid breakdown:** First generation fertile but subsequent
    generations are sterile.  
     **Hybrid sterility:** Hybrid offspring are sterile.

     Instructions: Watch Lecture 14, titled “Species and Speciation.”
    Adaptive radiation is a process through which many species arise
    from a single initial species.  It occurs when a single species
    migrates to a new area in which there are many different ecological
    niches unoccupied; populations of the initial species evolve to
    exploit those different niches, eventually resulting in many new
    species.  Darwin’s finches were thought to have undergone adaptive
    radiation.  
      
     Watching this lecture and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 1 hour.

**5.2 Rate of Speciation: Gradualist Model and Punctuated Equilibrium
Model** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Note: Although there is still some debate about the frequency through
which evolutionary change occurred via gradualism or punctuated
equilibrium, it is worth noting that one model does not discount the
other and that the two models do not have to be mutually exclusive.
 Punctuated equilibrium very often may have occurred in combination with
gradualism, and both models still recognize that the changes occurring
were slow in human terms.*
