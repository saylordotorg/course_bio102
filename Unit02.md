**Unit 2: Heredity and Inheritance** <span id="2"></span> 
*We have come to understand that the relationship between genotype and
phenotype is not always as simple as determining which genes are
dominant and which are recessive.  Human height, for example, does not
come in just two phenotypes (“short” and “tall”), but a continuous
variation.  In this unit, we will look at other major types of
inheritance, that is, types of inheritance that are not just dominant
versus recessive.  These other types become crucial in evolution.  As
organisms become more complex, adapting to the environment requires much
more than the expression of just two dominant and recessive phenotypes
for any given trait.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Understand the process of meiosis and how it affects inheritance,
    for example, via recombination.
-   Identify and give examples of situations in which traditional
    Mendelian Laws of Inheritance do not apply.
-   Use Punnett Squares to predict inheritance for traits that involve
    co-dominance, incomplete dominance, and sex-linkage.
